    "### Step 1: Initialize PyTerrier\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to initialize PyTerrier. This is typically done once per notebook or script.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pyterrier as pt\n",
    "if not pt.started():\n",
    "    pt.init()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Dataset Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "Load your dataset. You can use one of the datasets available in PyTerrier, or load your own dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of loading a dataset from PyTerrier\n",
    "dataset = pt.get_dataset('irds:your-dataset-name')\n",
    "# For custom datasets, you'd typically load them into a dataframe or similar structure\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Preprocessing and Query Rewriting\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the NLP-based query understanding and rewriting. You might use existing NLP libraries such as spaCy or Hugging Face's Transformers for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from your_query_rewriting_module import rewrite_query\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is a placeholder function. You will implement your query understanding and rewriting logic here.\n",
    "def preprocess_query(query):\n",
    "    # Use NLP techniques to understand and rewrite the query\n",
    "    rewritten_query = rewrite_query(query)\n",
    "    return rewritten_query\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Developing the IR System\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop your prototype IR system. This involves setting up the indexing and retrieval process.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Indexing\n",
    "indexer = pt.DFIndexer(\"./index_path\", overwrite=True)\n",
    "index_ref = indexer.index(dataset.get_corpus_iter())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieval\n",
    "# You can use one of PyTerrier's built-in retrieval models or develop your own.\n",
    "retriever = pt.BatchRetrieve(index_ref, wmodel=\"BM25\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Run experiments using your IR system. This includes query processing, retrieval, and evaluation against your benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyterrier.measures import RR, nDCG\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example query processing and retrieval\n",
    "def run_query_and_evaluate(query):\n",
    "    rewritten_query = preprocess_query(query)\n",
    "    result = retriever.transform(rewritten_query)\n",
    "    # Evaluation - assuming you have a test set with relevance judgments\n",
    "    eval_result = pt.Utils.evaluate(result, qrels, measures=[RR, nDCG])\n",
    "    return eval_result\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "query = \"Your test query\"\n",
    "evaluation_metrics = run_query_and_evaluate(query)\n",
    "print(evaluation_metrics)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the results to evaluate the effectiveness of your advanced query understanding and rewriting techniques."
